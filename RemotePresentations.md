ls<h1>Tips for Online Presenters</h1>


<h2>Content is king</h2>

it's more important that  the <b>content</b> of your presentation than how it is presented, but that doesn't mean that the presentation is unimportant.

Better audio and video will make you appear more professional, but even top-notch production values  will have people leaving if the content isn't interesting.

<h2>Show yourself</h2>

If your internet bandwidth is limited, it's ok to turn off your camera for the middle of the presentation. But at a minimum, turning it on to show your face at the start and end of the call gives your audience more chance to connect with you remind them that you are a human. 


<h2>If it's on the screen it's part of the presentation.</h2>

This means you, you’re clothing, what's behind you. If you’re sharing your screen that's:  
+  anything on your screen
+  your open applications
+  any pop-ups that may appear during your talk. 


<h2>Clear the Clutter</h2>

Remove anything from the room behind you, which will distract from what you’re presenting. I’ve seen piles of laundry in the background before! 

When using PowerPoint, use presenter mode rather than your edit mode. This cleans up the screen from visual noise and makes it easier to focus, and makes it look more professional. When sharing multiple windows or applications, Opt for “share your whole desktop” rather than just a single window and test this out in advance 

Turn off all pop-up notifications by setting your computer to do-not-disturb mode by .

<h2>Find somewhere quiet </h2> 
Choose a room where you can shut out noise and distractions. Also, close any doors and windows to keep out the noise of traffic / emergency sirens.

If an interruption does happen, don’t panic. Watch  the BBC interview of Professor Robert Kelly - it's well worth 43 seconds to watch it. Everyone knows you are a human, so just deal with the interuption calmly.
  
+ If other people are also at home, make sure they aren't  streaming video whilst you are presenting. This could impact the flow of your presentation.


<h2>Explain the structure  of the session</h2>

+ If you are expecting questions, explain how you want this to happen: by collecting comments during the presentation in the messages box, or by keeping some time back at the end, etc. so that everyone knows what to expect.

<h2>Don't Ramble - Short is best. <h2>

People are generally prepared to sit and listen for 6-20 minutes. if you need to keep people for longer, either break the activity into shorter pieces, or ask for feedback in the chat section - maybe a quick survey - so that the people stay engaged and active - you can also do this easily with a google form 

<h2>Technical Tips</h2>

Improve the lighting

If you think the light in the middle of the ceiling and illumination from your monitor will be ok, think again. Add some light outside of the video frame. A plain household lamp (with shade) that provides soft illumination is your best option. Set it to one side of your camera at about 45 degrees. Even better would be a pair of lamps - one on each side of the camera at 45 degrees.

Improve the sound

Use an external microphone - or a discrete headset. Try not to rely on the microphone on a laptop as it will likely pick up noises from your hands on the keys or desk.

Don't get too close to the camera, and position it at eye level.

This can be tricky if it's a built in webcam on a laptop, but you can try to keep the laptop at arms length and raise it up to eye level, so that people aren't looking up your nose - this is no-ones best look.
